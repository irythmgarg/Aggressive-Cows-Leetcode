Question Statement
You are given n stalls located at different positions (represented by a sorted array stalls) and an integer k,
representing the number of cows. The task is to determine the largest minimum distance between any two cows,
such that all k cows can be placed in the stalls.

Solution Explanation
Problem Requirements:

Place k cows in n stalls such that the minimum distance between any two cows is maximized.
The minimum distance between two cows can range from 1 to the difference between the first and last stall.
Approach:

Use binary search to determine the largest minimum distance:
Start with the range [1, stalls[n - 1] - stalls[0]].
Define a helper function func to check if cows can be placed with a given minimum distance (mid).
Steps:

Sort the stalls to simplify distance calculations.
Perform binary search:
For each mid, check if placing k cows with at least mid distance is possible using func.
If possible, try for a larger distance by increasing s.
Otherwise, reduce the distance by decreasing e.
Returning the Result:

After the binary search, ans contains the largest minimum distance where all cows can be placed.
Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity:

Sorting: Sorting the stalls takes O(nlogn).
Space Complexity:

The space complexity is O(1) as no additional space is used.
